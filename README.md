# React-Pagination

In pagination you can keep making requests to your server, and you get certain amount from the database

**Or you can have frontend pagination which is what we're doing where you make an initial for let's say a hundred different posts and then you create the functionality so you can have maybe 5 per page or 10 per page.**

for example we use JsonPlaceholder/posts api.

And we get hundred different posts. Now we want to make it show 5 per page or 10 per page and then have some nice you know pagination numbers at the bottom that we can scroll through and we're going to be using bootstrap for the styling
